In this application, the user has the option to either view or add an evacuee to the connected SQL-Alchemy database.

Basic Synopsis: With more natural disasters occurring each year, residents are often displaced from their homes and relocated to evacuation centers. These evacuation centers provide temporary shelter to those impacted by a calamity. A lack of standardization in record keeping often results in poor distribution of resources, creating unnecessary obstacles for the victims and the greater community. This capstone project will help in resolving these issues with the creation of a local web database system where the user can add new evacuees and query evacuee data.
